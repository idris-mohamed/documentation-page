        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on. 
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">Hello, World</p>
         <p>If you want to write as a main header within the page, we could specify that it is a heading "1" by enclosing it in a heading &lt;h1&gt; element</p>
         <code class="highlight">Example: &lt;h1&gt; Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code>

      <p>The main parts of our element are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.
        </li>
        <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li>
          The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
        </li>
        <li>The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <p>
        You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
      </p>
      <code class="highlight">
       &lt;p&gt; My cat is &lt;strong&gt; very &lt;strong&gt; grumpy. &lt;/p&gt;
</code>
       <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we opened the "p" element first, then the "strong" element, therefore we have to close the "strong" element first, then the "p". The following is incorrect:
       </p>
       <code class="highlight">
       &lt;p&gt; My cat is &lt;strong&gt; very  grumpy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
</code>

    <article>
      <p>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — they will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. Block-level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</p>
      <code class="highlight">Example: &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
         </code>
         <ul>
           <li>
             &lt;p&gt; is a block-level element, each element appears on a new line, with space above and below each
           </li>
         </ul>
         <div class="highlight"><p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p><p></p>
         </div>
    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Inline_Element">

    <p>
      Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only small parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document; they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text,
    </p>
    <code class="highlight">
           &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;
           &lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;
           &lt;em&gt;Third&lt;/em&gt;
         </code>
         <ul>
          <li>
           &lt;em&gt;is an inline element, so as you can see below, the first three elements sit on the same line as one another with no space in between.
           </li>
         </ul>    

         <code class="highlight">Example: <em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em></code>
